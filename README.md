DDoS Attack Visualizer & Network Stress Simulator

A high-fidelity, real-time educational simulation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, server load equilibrium, and mitigation strategies.

Architected and coded entirely by Gemini 3 Pro.

🚀 Overview

This project is an interactive, browser-based simulator designed to visualize the mechanics of network traffic overload and defense systems. Unlike simple "health bar" games, this simulator utilizes a robust mathematical core based on real-world infrastructure data (Cloudflare/AWS benchmarks) to model how servers degrade under pressure.

It demonstrates the delicate balance between Legitimate Traffic (Users) and Malicious Traffic (Botnets), calculating Service Availability and Latency in real-time.

✨ Key Features

⚛️ React-Based Particle Engine: A high-performance, non-Canvas DOM visualization engine running at 60FPS, capable of rendering thousands of "ghost" packets to simulate millions of requests.

🧮 Real-World Math Models:

Logarithmic Attack Scaling: Attack intensity scales exponentially, simulating botnets ranging from 1k to 20 Million RPS.

Equilibrium Logic: Servers don't just "die"; they stabilize at degraded states (e.g., 50% availability) based on the ratio of Incoming Demand vs. Capacity.

Latency Simulation: Models TCP congestion using "hockey-stick" curves, where latency spikes exponentially as load crosses 80%.

🛡️ Defense Mechanics:

WAF Saturation: Firewalls aren't magic; they degrade in efficiency as CPU limits are hit by volumetric attacks.

Infrastructure Tiers: Switch between a single VPS, an Enterprise Cluster, or a Global Anycast Edge Network.

📊 Live Telemetry: Real-time monitoring of Requests Per Second (RPS), Legitimate vs. Attack ratios, CPU Load, and Server Integrity.
